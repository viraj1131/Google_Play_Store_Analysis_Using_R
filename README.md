# Google_Play_Store_Analysis_Using_R
Here i have used Google Play store dataset from Kaggle.com.In this Whole Project My main hypothesis was to predict Google App Rating based upon Google App Reviews and Google App Installs using simple linear regression and in order to do this i have gone through several steps. First, i have tried to visualize whole dataset to get insight than i have done Exploratory Data Analysis of all three variables on which i  applied bivariate and univariate analysis.At last i have tried to apply linear regression model to find relationship or to predict Google App Rating based upon Google App Reviews and Google App Installs.
